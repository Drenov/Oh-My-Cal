#### Why Oh My Cal! ?
You may want to ask: *The Calculator.app in OS X is powerful, why should I use the Oh My Cal! ?*

The Calculator.app in OS X is powerful, but it's not convenient. For me, I usually use many apps in fullscreen mode( Xcode, Evernote, etc.). Whenever I want to calculate some formulas, I have to switch among several apps or screens. Oh, I really could not stand!!! So I wrote Oh My Cal!. In addition to as powerful as the Calculator.app in OS X, it's very convenient to use (Global Callout or Hanging in menu bar).

#### What's New in This Version?
* Full feature: supports Basic/Scientific/Programmer mode.
* Supports global callout.
* Killed some fucking bugs.
