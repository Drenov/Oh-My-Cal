It's very cool and convenient!\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/oh-my-cal!/id916544190?l=en&mt=12\"><img src=\"http://i.imgbox.com/ALR2Xgvf.png\" alt=\"Oh My Cal! / Mac OS\" title=\"Oh My Cal! / Mac OS\" border=\"0\" width=\"156\" height=\"38\" /></a> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nBenefit Highlighting:\r\n\r\n* Supports Basic/Scientific/Programmer mode.\r\n\r\n* In programmer mode, you can calculate in Decimal, Octal, Hex and Binary and convert them each other.\r\n\r\n* Very convenient to use, you can callout calculator in any workspace using the global key combination.

For me, I usually use many apps in fullscreen mode( Xcode, Evernote, etc.). Whenever I want to calculate some formulas, I have to switch among several apps or screens. Oh, I really could not stand!!! So I wrote Oh My Cal!. In addition to as powerful as the Calculator.app in OS X, it's very convenient to use (Global Callout or Hanging in menu bar).\r\n\r\n#### What's New in This Version (v2.0.2)?\r\n* Full feature: supports Basic/Scientific/Programmer mode.\r\n* Supports global callout.\r\n* Stability improved.\r\n* Killed some fucking bugs\r\n    * Lagging when switch OCT/DEC/HEX mode.\r\n    *  The Enter, Clear and Equal button on the \"Apple Keyboard With Numeric Keypad\" all do not work. ( found by Mr. Tobias Kroniger ).\r\n\r\n#### Contact Me\r\nIf you encounter any issue, you can email me: <Tong-G@outlook.com> or DM me on Twitter: [ @NSTongG ]( https://twitter.com/NSTongG )\r\n\r\nIf you are using GnuPG, you can send me encrypt email, my GnuPG pub key is **0x67B9E95236924648**, you can retrieve it from keyserver.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:10pt;line-height:1.5;background-color:#FFE500;\"> Oh My Cal! is free software, you are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, the source code of Oh My Cal!.
